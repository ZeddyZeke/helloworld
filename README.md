# hello-world
My first Hello world at github.

Hello human specie and above(AI or wtv)!
I'm ZeddyZeke and I've been in touch with lines of code since my adolescense, but never got motivation to learn, nor even now.
Just came here from Genymobile's repository called scrcpy, since I saw it on portuguese blog abertoatedemadrugada.com or aadm.pt

Kisses
